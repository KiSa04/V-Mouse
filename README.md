This project is a fork of MAVT, though aimed only at flip phones, it brings:

  1. Fixed scroll feature
  2. Auto-scroll when reaching the borders of the screen
  3. Fixed longpress to activate the mouse
  4. Fixed D-PAD_CENTER not working after switching from Mouse Mode
  5. Fixed the layout of the GUI (now in Portrait mode and working in small screens)

To Do:

  1. Create an option to have a different boss key just for scrolling
  2. Create a longpress option while using the mouse
